# top-circuits

A sleek, responsive website showcasing top-tier printed-circuit-board (PCB) design and manufacturing concepts.  
Built using HTML, CSS & JavaScript.

## 🚀 Live Demo  
Check it out live at: [https://top-circuits.vercel.app](https://top-circuits.vercel.app)

## Features  
- Clean, modern UI with emphasis on PCB visuals (double-layer PCBs, trace routing, etc)  
- Responsive layout for desktops, tablets and mobile devices  
- Lightweight and fast: only HTML, CSS and vanilla JS  
- Easily extendable: add more circuit images or sections  

## 🧰 Tech Stack  
- **HTML** – semantic markup  
- **CSS** – custom styles for layout, animations and responsiveness  
- **JavaScript** – small behaviour enhancements (e.g., image interactions)  
- Minor assets: images (e.g., `double-layer-pcb.jpg`, `download.png`)  
- Directory structure:  

├─ index.html
├─ style.css
├─ script.js
├─ images/
└─ sitemap.xml 


## 📂 Installation & Setup  
1. Clone the repository  
 ```bash
